        <li><p>Used the <a href="http://essentia.upf.edu/documentation/index.html" target="_blank">Essentia</a> audio analysis library
                to determine whether the tempo of a .wav file was slower than the desired tempo.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><b>Role: </b>Installed and figured out how to work with the Essentia library.
            Wrote modularized functions to interface between the general algorithm and the Essentia Library.</p></li>
